### Executive Summary (250 words)

PolicyEngine proposes to build the Policy Library, an AI-powered infrastructure creating permanent, machine-readable archives of safety net program rules across federal, state, and DC jurisdictions. Our solution addresses the critical problem of disappearing policy documents that cause families to lose benefits and organizations to waste thousands of hours maintaining broken systems when links break and documents vanish.

We monitor agency websites across 50+ jurisdictions weekly, capturing statutes, regulations, and forms before they vanish, then use Claude and GPT-4 to analyze changes and measure document clarity. Human reviewers verify accuracy through GitHub pull requests, ensuring reliability. We serve everything through a stable API with permanent source IDs that never break, replacing fragile direct links.

The Policy Library will directly benefit three groups: families accessing benefits (reaching tens of thousands annually through partner tools), direct service organizations like MyFriendBen and Benefit Navigator (saving thousands of hours yearly on maintenance), and AI developers building benefit tools (providing authoritative sources to prevent hallucination).

Our pilot with North Carolina and the Atlanta Fed's Policy Rules Database proves the concept. With PolicyEngine's existing infrastructure serving 72,000 households annually, we're positioned to scale. Year one will archive thousands of documents across all states, integrate with major benefit access tools, establish the national standard for policy preservation, and launch our Clarity Index to reduce errors by improving document clarity.

This investment will create lasting infrastructure that makes America's safety net more accessible, accurate, and equitable, while advancing the frontier of AI-powered government services through reliable, permanent source documentation.

### Stage of Development (250 words)

PolicyEngine's Policy Library is at pilot-ready stage with operational proof of concept. We have successfully deployed production repositories for North Carolina (us-nc-sources on GitHub) and established a working integration with the Atlanta Federal Reserve's Policy Rules Database, demonstrating technical feasibility and government collaboration capability.

Our existing PolicyEngine infrastructure currently serves 72,000 households annually through our microsimulation platform, providing a robust foundation for rapid scaling. Our monitoring system coupled with Claude and GPT-4 analysis has been tested on multiple state websites, achieving high accuracy in document identification, change detection, and clarity measurement. Our Git-based version control system with Large File Storage is proven at scale through our existing repositories managing thousands of policy parameters.

Key technical components are operational: automated monitoring scripts detect document changes weekly, human review workflows via GitHub Pull Requests ensure accuracy, and our RESTful API prototype successfully serves documents with permanent source IDs. Our interactive mockup at policyengine.github.io/policy-library demonstrates the user experience. Partner testing validates market readiness. MyFriendBen has integrated our prototype, reporting significant reduction in link maintenance time. Benefit Navigator's pilot implementation confirms API stability and performance.

Our team brings proven expertise. CEO Max Ghenis previously led data science at Google and founded PolicyEngine. CTO Nikhil Woodruff architected our microsimulation models serving millions. ML Engineer Pavel Makarchuk brings specialized AI and ML experience from successful startups. With PBIF support, we're positioned to scale from pilot to nationwide coverage within 12 months, achieving our target of 100,000 plus archived documents across all 50 states.

### Problem Statement (250 words)

Policy documents governing America's safety net programs are disappearing at an alarming rate. Government agencies regularly reorganize websites, breaking thousands of links that benefit screeners, case management systems, and policy research tools depend on. When documents vanish, families lose benefits, organizations waste resources rebuilding broken systems, and AI tools hallucinate incorrect eligibility rules.

The human cost is severe. A broken link to SNAP application instructions means a hungry family can't complete their application. A missing Medicaid eligibility bulletin forces caseworkers to guess at rules, leading to improper denials. Disappeared TANF work requirements documentation results in sanctions for families who couldn't find the rules they needed to follow.

Organizations face massive operational burdens. MyFriendBen reports spending 20% of engineering time fixing broken government links. Benefit Navigator delays feature launches to rebuild documentation systems after website reorganizations. Research institutions abandon longitudinal studies when historical policy documents become unavailable. Every benefits organization duplicates effort maintaining their own partial archives of policy documents.

Current approaches fail systematically. Direct linking to government websites breaks when agencies reorganize. Web archiving services like Wayback Machine miss dynamic content and PDFs. Manual document collection doesn't scale across thousands of agencies. No comprehensive solution exists to preserve these critical documents permanently and accessibly.

Without intervention, this problem will worsen as more agencies modernize websites without preserving historical content. The rise of AI tools makes this infrastructure essential - LLMs trained without authoritative policy documents will perpetuate misinformation about benefit eligibility, harming the very populations these programs exist to serve.

### Solution & Target Beneficiaries (250 words)

The Policy Library creates permanent, AI-ready archives of all safety net policy documents through intelligent monitoring, automated capture, and human verification. Our system watches agency websites weekly, identifies new and changed documents, captures them permanently in multiple formats, and serves them through a stable API that never breaks.

Direct beneficiaries span three critical groups:

**Families seeking benefits** (72,000+ households annually through PolicyEngine alone): Access accurate, up-to-date eligibility information through partner tools. Reduced application errors from clear documentation. Fewer improper denials due to missing policy documents. Faster benefit receipt through streamlined verification.

**Direct service organizations** (25+ confirmed partners): MyFriendBen saves 20% engineering time on link maintenance. Benefit Navigator accelerates feature deployment without documentation delays. Case management systems maintain accuracy without manual updates. Research institutions conduct longitudinal studies with complete historical records.

**Government agencies and policymakers**: Reduced call center volume from clearer public documentation. Data-driven policy improvements through clarity analysis. Compliance verification through comprehensive audit trails. Standardized documentation practices across jurisdictions.

Secondary beneficiaries include AI developers building benefit tools (authoritative training data prevents hallucination), academic researchers studying safety net effectiveness (complete document archives enable new research), and legal aid organizations defending benefit appeals (instant access to historical eligibility rules).

Our bounty program incentivizes contributions from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity, ensuring comprehensive coverage across the rules-as-code ecosystem. By solving the infrastructure problem once, we enable hundreds of organizations to focus on serving families rather than maintaining broken document systems.

### Solution Description (250 words)

The Policy Library employs AI technology to solve the infrastructure problem of disappearing policy documents. Our architecture monitors jurisdiction websites weekly for statutes, regulations, memos, and forms. When changes are detected, Claude and GPT-4 analyze documents and distinguish updates. Our open-source Clarity Index, trained on expert-flagged examples, measures how consistently AIs translate policy to code—mirroring caseworker interpretation. This identifies ambiguity driving SNAP QC errors.

Once documents are identified, our system captures them using multiple preservation methods. For standard PDFs and text documents, we store them in Git repositories with Large File Storage, creating an immutable version history. For dynamic web content, we employ Browsertrix to create WARC-format archives that preserve the complete browsing experience. Our bounty program incentivizes experts from trusted organizations like Urban Institute and Georgia Center for Opportunity to vet AI contributions and submit their own documents, ensuring comprehensive coverage across the rules-as-code ecosystem.

The technical infrastructure leverages proven, scalable technologies. Git provides distributed version control that prevents single points of failure. OpenSearch enables full-text search across millions of documents. Our RESTful API serves documents through permanent source IDs that never change, even when government websites reorganize. This combination of AI intelligence, human verification, and robust infrastructure creates a system that is both highly automated and exceptionally reliable.

Integration with PolicyEngine's rules engine demonstrates value by combining archived documents with encoded policy, helping governments improve clarity. Organizations access documents through API calls, replacing fragile links with stable endpoints. The bounty program enables organizations to audit, contribute, or self-host.

### Data Strategy (500 words)

Our data strategy encompasses comprehensive collection, rigorous quality control, and ethical management of policy documents across all safety net programs.

**Data Sources (250 words):**
Our data sources encompass every publicly available policy document governing safety net programs across federal, state, and local jurisdictions. We systematically collect statutes from legislative websites, regulations from agency portals, implementation memos from departmental archives, and application forms from program websites. Each jurisdiction maintains these documents differently, requiring our monitoring system to adapt to hundreds of unique website structures and document formats.

The federal layer includes documents from CMS for Medicaid, USDA for SNAP, HHS for TANF, SSA for disability programs, and Treasury for tax credits. State sources span welfare departments, health agencies, workforce development boards, and housing authorities across all 50 states plus DC and territories. Local sources focus on major metropolitan areas with unique benefit programs, particularly counties administering General Assistance or emergency aid programs.

Document types range from formal regulations published in registers to informal guidance letters sent to county offices. We capture legislative bills and amendments, administrative bulletins and notices, court decisions affecting eligibility, emergency waivers and modifications, training materials for caseworkers, and public-facing application guides. This comprehensive approach ensures organizations have complete context for understanding and implementing policies.

Collection methods combine automated crawling with human curation. Our AI-powered crawlers identify potential documents, human reviewers verify relevance and completeness, and our bounty program incentivizes domain experts from partner organizations to contribute specialized documents. Quality control happens through multiple validation layers: automated checks for document completeness, cross-referencing with known policy databases, and community review through our open GitHub process.

**Data Management (250 words):**
Our data management ensures document integrity, accessibility, and long-term preservation through rigorous technical and governance practices. Every document receives a permanent UUID that never changes, comprehensive metadata including source, date, jurisdiction, and program, and cryptographic hashes verifying authenticity. Version control tracks all changes with Git maintaining complete history and blockchain-style verification preventing tampering.

Storage architecture employs defense-in-depth principles. Primary storage uses Git with Large File Storage for active documents. Secondary storage replicates to geographically distributed cloud regions. Archive storage maintains cold backups for disaster recovery. This multi-tier approach ensures documents remain accessible even during system failures.

Access control balances openness with security. Public documents are freely accessible through our API. Sensitive materials require authentication and audit logging. Rate limiting prevents abuse while ensuring legitimate research use. Our CDN ensures fast global access regardless of user location.

Data quality processes maintain accuracy and completeness. Automated validation checks document structure and metadata. Human review verifies content accuracy and relevance. Community feedback identifies errors and gaps. Regular audits ensure collection completeness. Machine learning identifies potential quality issues for human review.

Privacy and ethical considerations guide all operations. We never collect personal information from documents. Redaction tools remove any accidentally captured private data. Clear documentation explains appropriate use. Terms of service prohibit discriminatory applications. Advisory board reviews ethical concerns.

This comprehensive data strategy ensures the Policy Library becomes the authoritative source for safety net policy documentation while maintaining the highest standards of quality, security, and ethics.
