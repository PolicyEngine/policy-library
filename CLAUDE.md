# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **PolicyEngine Policy Library** repository - a PBIF (Public Benefit Innovation Fund) application project aimed at creating an AI-powered, permanently archived collection of policy documents for safety net programs across jurisdictions. The project preserves source documents (statutes, regulations, forms) that PolicyEngine and other tools then encode into rules.

## Project Context

### Core Concept
- **Purpose**: Create an immutable archive of benefit program documents to prevent link rot and document disappearance
- **Approach**: AI crawlers monitor agency websites → Human reviewers verify via GitHub PRs → Stable API serves documents with permanent source IDs
- **Target**: 50+ jurisdictions (federal + states) with 100,000+ documents archived in Year 1
- **AI Integration**: Uses Claude/GPT-4 for intelligent document extraction and improves LLM benefit calculations

### PBIF Application Details
- **Application Deadline**: August 16, 2025, 11:59 PM Pacific Time
- **Funding Request**: $700,000 (within PBIF range of $500K-$2M)
- **Grant Period**: 2 years with 12-month production deployment requirement
- **Focus**: AI-enabled technology reducing administrative burden for SNAP, Medicaid, and other safety net programs

### Key Partners & Users
- **Direct Service Tools**: MyFriendBen (~3,500 screeners/month in CO), Benefit Navigator (Gates/Nava AI partnership), Navvy
- **Research Institutions**: Georgetown, University of Michigan, NBER
- **Government**: Atlanta Fed (advisor with Policy Rules Database collaboration), Georgia Center for Opportunity
- **Impact**: Tools powered by PolicyEngine reach ~160,000 individuals annually (72,000 households)

### Existing Work
- **Pilot Repositories**: us-nc-sources (North Carolina), collaboration with Atlanta Fed Policy Rules Database
- **Related Projects**: Can reference styling from ../state-legislative-district-mock
- **Nonprofit ENGINE**: Complementary application for engineering capacity

## Development Commands

```

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation (MVP/Mock)
- Single HTML file combining one-pager and interactive mock
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript for GitHub Pages compatibility
- No build system required

### Planned Production Architecture
- **AI Crawling**: Claude/GPT-4 powered intelligent extraction
- **Storage**: Git repositories (one per jurisdiction) with Git LFS for PDFs
- **Web Archiving**: Browsertrix for web-based statutes/regulations (WARC format)
- **Search**: OpenSearch for full-text search capabilities
- **API**: Stable source_id system to replace fragile direct links
- **LLM Benchmark**: Comparison of accuracy with/without source documents

## PBIF Budget Google Sheets Automation

**IMPORTANT**: We have a Python package `pbif_budget_filler/` that directly updates the PBIF budget in Google Sheets.

### Key Scripts:
- `update_partner_allocations.py` - Updates partner funding amounts (MFB, BN, GCO, etc.)
- `update_expanded_partners.py` - Updates budget to $700k with expanded partner network
- `final_correct_fill.py` - Main script to fill the entire budget spreadsheet
- Uses `gspread` with credentials in `token.pickle`
- Spreadsheet ID: `1sJdmn3IF09h0YA7hYeem80CCfDc1z8jYdeCkq5Phknw`

### To Update Budget in Google Sheets:
```bash
cd pbif_budget_filler
python update_partner_allocations.py  # Or create new script with updated amounts
```

**Note**: Prenatal-to-3 Policy Impact Center contributes documents without receiving funding

## Timeline

- **Months 1-3**: Core infrastructure, AI crawler development
- **Months 4-6**: 10 state pilots, partner integration
- **Months 7-9**: Scale to 30 states, API launch
- **Months 10-12**: Full 50+ jurisdiction deployment, LLM benchmark

## Important Considerations

1. **Document vs Rules**: This library archives source documents, not encoded rules. PolicyEngine and other tools handle the encoding/interpretation.

2. **AI Focus for PBIF**: Emphasize AI-powered crawling, LLM benchmarking, and accuracy improvements when discussing with funders.

3. **Production Deployment**: Must deploy with real data within 12 months per PBIF requirements.

4. **Open Source**: Maintain open access to maximize impact and partner adoption.

5. **Sustainability**: After Year 2, system becomes self-sustaining through PolicyEngine's API revenue model.
