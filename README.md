# PolicyEngine Policy Library

AI-powered infrastructure for preserving and serving America's safety net policy documents.

## Overview

The Policy Library addresses a critical infrastructure failure: benefit program documents disappear constantly. This system uses AI-powered crawlers to monitor 50+ jurisdictions, capturing statutes, regulations, and forms before they vanish.
